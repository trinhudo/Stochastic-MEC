In this paper, we provide:
- Introduction of a new uplink-downlink **_stochastic mobile edge computing (MEC) system_**, considering the dynamic characteristics of small cell base stations (SBSs) and user equipments (UEs).  
- Development of a radio resource management strategy focusing on user association, channel allocation, and power allocation, incorporating time, energy, and achievable rate into the utility function.  
- Identification of the problem as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), acknowledged as NP-hard.  
- Proposal of a nature-inspired optimization framework to simplify the complexity, adaptable for subproblems in various settings and integrable with Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).  
- Mathematical and numerical analysis showing the proposed algorithms' ability to reach near-optimal solutions with minimal optimality gaps.  
- Numerical results highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithms for resource management in MEC systems, and evaluating the impact of stochastic characteristics on MEC performance.
